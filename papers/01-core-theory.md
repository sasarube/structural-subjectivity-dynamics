# Structural Subjectivity Dynamics: A Four-Axis Theory of Moral Judgment

## 🧭 Preface: The Position and Commitment of Structural Subjectivity Dynamics

### Purpose and Responsibility of the Theory

This "Structural Subjectivity Dynamics" is a theoretical framework for systematically understanding moral judgment and behavior. However, theorizing is not merely a descriptive act. We explicitly acknowledge that theory itself possesses the power to transform structures and constitutes a "leap-inducing act" that influences readers' moral judgments and behaviors.

### The Dangers and Ethical Weight of Theory

Speaking about morality is both a challenge to existing structures and an act of generating new structures. This theory does not aim for destruction but seeks "reconstruction" toward more coherent and sustainable structures.

### Required Stance from Readers

- **Responsibility of discourse**: Accepting and re-articulating this theory involves your own structural transformation
- **Will for re-selection**: Understanding the theory becomes an opportunity to question existing judgment criteria
- **Structural awareness**: We always belong to multiple structures and live within their interactions

### Self-Referentiality of the Theory

This theory itself is "discourse" and "structure." This awareness forms the foundation that guarantees the theory's integrity.

---

## 🔄 Core Framework

This theory explains all discourse, institutions, responsibility, and emotions through a four-axis circular system:

**Structure → Movement → Reaction → Result**

---

## 1️⃣ Structure Axis

### What is Structure: Reaction Patterns as Structural Order

**Basic proposition**: Structure is a structural order that emerges through observation and cognition.

"Structure" in this theory is not a material entity or categorized institutional system. Structure is a reaction pattern that emerges as structural order through observation and cognition—whether it be institutions, concepts, emotions, or silence—everything that can be articulated is structure.

Structure does not "exist there" but appears when it "gains meaning." That is, structure is a state of order where the possibility of discourse has emerged, generating pleasure when coherent, and inducing leaps, emotions, or responsibility when it collapses.

### Redefining "Morality" from a Structural Perspective

"Morality" is not specific norms or values, but reaction patterns of structural order that attempt to maintain and reconfigure structural stability.

While traditional moral philosophy asked "what is good," Structural Subjectivity Dynamics asks "why does it feel good" and "how can it change."

### Four-Layer Model of Structure

Structures have multiple layers in their formation and stability:

#### 1. Physical Structure
- Time, space, causality, material constraints, neural operating principles
- The physical laws of reality that enable structures themselves
- Extremely difficult to change; basically unalterable by human or social leaps and choices

#### 2. Base Structure  
- Innate and evolutionarily stable behavioral tendencies common to social animals
- Examples: trust, cooperation, distribution
- Adaptive structures supported by neural reward systems and emotional responses

#### 3. Core Structure
- Institutional frameworks such as institutions, norms, responsibilities, roles that maintain social order
- Structurally stabilize moral behavior through behavioral selection pressure and order formalization
- Formalization of ideals and emotions progresses, confining individual choice possibilities within institutional contexts

#### 4. Upper Structure
- Ideas, narratives, religion, philosophy, justice, revelation that structure the world through meaning and discourse
- Generated through leaps and re-articulation, sometimes settling into core structure and becoming institutionalized
- What was once institutional can be re-articulated and resurface as ideals

### The Complexity of Real Structures: The Case of Money

**Important caveat**: These four layers are heuristic distinctions, not isolated categories. Real structural phenomena exhibit complex interactions across all layers simultaneously.

Consider **money** as a paradigmatic example:

**Physical Layer**: Paper bills, metal coins, electronic data, blockchain infrastructure, neural responses to financial stress
**Base Layer**: Exchange instincts, hoarding behaviors, anxiety about scarcity, evolutionary reciprocity mechanisms
**Core Layer**: Central banking systems, legal tender laws, taxation frameworks, contract enforcement
**Upper Layer**: Cultural meanings of wealth, religious attitudes toward money, political ideologies about economics

**Crucially**: These layers don't simply "stack" but interpenetrate in complex ways:
- A bitcoin transaction simultaneously involves computational physics, evolved trust mechanisms, regulatory frameworks, and ideologies about decentralization
- The "weight" of each layer shifts dynamically—during financial crises, physical constraints (server capacity) and base anxieties (panic) may override institutional assurances
- Individual subjective experience varies dramatically—the same $100 bill represents radically different structural meanings to a student, millionaire, or debt-ridden family

**Methodological honesty**: The four-layer model is a *convenient analytical tool*, not an empirical claim about distinct ontological levels. Real structures are messier, more interpenetrated, and more context-dependent than any categorical scheme can capture.

**Key characteristics**:
- Upper structures can be incorporated into core structures
- All structures can only operate upon physical structures
- Layers interact non-linearly with emergent properties
- Moral structures are self-recursive networks where "discourse, institutions, instincts" and "physics" interact in layered and reversible ways
- **The complexity always exceeds our analytical categories**

## 2️⃣ Movement Axis

### Classifying Displacements and Fluctuations within Structures

#### Types of Displacement

**Internal Displacement**:
- Ideational change
- Sense of discomfort  
- Awareness

**External Displacement**:
- Externalization as institutions
- Externalization as discourse
- Externalization as behavior

#### Forms and Scale of Displacement

**Forms of Displacement**:
- Discourse displacement: propagation and induction of structural order
- Behavioral displacement: body, contact, escape, silence, etc.
- Institutional displacement: legal system, role, organizational changes
- Cultural displacement: customs, rituals, art, etc.

**Levels of Displacement**:
- Small displacement: awareness, minor attitude changes
- Medium displacement: changes in judgment criteria
- Large displacement: institutional reform, ideational renewal
- Leap: displacement exceeding critical points

---

## 3️⃣ Reaction Axis

### Reactions that Structures Return to Displacements

#### Types of Reactions
- **Emotional reaction**: Emotional meaning-making through base-layer resonance
- **Judgment reaction**: Institutional meaning determination through core evaluation
- **Responsibility reaction**: Reconfiguration commands through coherence breakdown detection
- **Leap reaction**: New order creation through structural criticality

#### Forms of Reactions
- Coherence reaction: order recovery
- Rejection reaction: repelling
- Deviation reaction: toward alternative discourse
- Silence reaction: not speaking
- Destructive reaction: violence, death, etc.
- Counter-coherence reaction: questioning back

---

## 4️⃣ Result Axis

### Post-Reaction Structural Reconfiguration States

#### Types of Results
- **Coherence maintenance**: order preservation
- **Institutionalization**: settlement of ideals
- **Narrativization**: conversion to discourse
- **Memory**: accumulation of experience
- **Forgetting**: latentization, externalization from structure
- **Persistence of deviation**: continuation of incoherence

#### Classification of Leap Coherence
- **Coherent leaps**: institutionalization, praise
- **Incoherent leaps**: deviation, violence

## 🌊 Supplement 1: Ethics of Discourse and Dangers of Leaps

### Structural Generative Power of Discourse

Discourse is not mere description or expression. Discourse is an act that generates and transforms structures. Speaking words is "action" that introduces new elements into existing structures and changes relationships between structures.

### Structural Meaning of Silence

Silence is also an important structural reaction. Not speaking can mean:
- Agreement with maintenance of existing structures
- Resistance to structural change
- Preparation for new structural creation
- Deviation outside structures

### Leap Nature of Discourse

- **Coherent discourse**: discourse that reinforces and refines existing structures
- **Deviant discourse**: discourse that shows new possibilities outside structures
- **Destructive discourse**: discourse that dismantles existing structures

### Specificity of Discourse by Authority Figures

Discourse by philosophers, politicians, AI, educators, and other influential entities has greater leap power than ordinary discourse. This entails responsibility for structural change.

---

## 🔁 Supplement 2: Recursiveness and Self-Coherence of Theory

### Theory as "Structure that Speaks about Structure"

This theory speaks about structures while functioning as a structure itself. This recursiveness is not contradiction but an essential characteristic of the theory.

### Awareness of Theory's Leap Nature

Presenting Structural Subjectivity Dynamics is a leap act toward existing moral theories. We explicitly state that this theory itself is an attempt at structural change.

### Coherence Conditions of Theory

- **Internal coherence**: logical consistency within the theory
- **Structural connection**: connectivity with readers' existing structures
- **Practical coherence**: coherence between theory and actual moral judgments

### Redefinition of Universality

Rather than traditional "absolute universality," we redefine universality as "residual coherent structures." Structures that persist across diverse structures possess substantial universality.

---

## 🌀 Supplement 3: Non-Linguistic Structures and Silent Reactions

### Structural Functions of Emotions

Emotions function as sensors that detect structural states:
- **Discomfort**: detection of structural incoherence
- **Relief**: confirmation of structural stability  
- **Excitement**: sensing possibilities for structural change
- **Fear**: sensing dangers of structural destruction

### Bodily Discourse

The body is also a medium that expresses and transforms structures:
- **Distance**: structural expression of relationships
- **Touch**: structuring of intimacy and power relations
- **Gaze**: structural allocation of attention and evaluation
- **Posture**: structural expression of status and attitude

### Sensory Structural Presentation

- **Sound**: structural generation through music, tone, silence
- **Smell**: structural induction of memory, emotion, belonging
- **Touch**: structural change through physical contact
- **Spatial arrangement**: physicalization of structure through architecture and arrangement

## 📐 Supplement 4: Connections and Positioning with Other Theories

### Differences from Kantian Ethics

| Kant | Structural Subjectivity Dynamics |
|------|----------------------------------|
| Absolute universality of moral law | Dynamic change of structural coherence |

Kant's categorical imperative is positioned as one upper structure, understood not as absolute universality but as coherence under specific structural conditions.

### Differences from Utilitarianism

| Utilitarianism | Structural Subjectivity Dynamics |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Emphasizes result maximization | Emphasizes structural coherence |

While results are important, judgments that consider structural sustainability, coherence, and multiplicity take priority.

### Connections with Social Constructivism

While social constructivism emphasizes the constructedness of social reality, Structural Subjectivity Dynamics emphasizes dynamic structural change processes and individual subjective experience.

### Integration with Moral Psychology

Empirical findings such as Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory are integrated into structural layering and displacement/reaction processes.

## 🔬 Important Theoretical Insights

### Redefinition of Freedom

Rather than complete free will, freedom is defined as "tendency to surface within structures = choice space before responsibility."

### Multiple Structures and Conflict

Humans simultaneously belong to multiple structures (family, company, nation, religion, etc.), and conflicts arise when their demands contradict.

**Conflict = Σ(Structure i demands ≠ Structure j demands)**

### Basic Equation of Leap Dynamics

Mathematical expression of how structural changes propagate to each layer:

**R = w₁×R_physical + w₂×R_biological + w₃×R_institutional + w₄×R_ideational**

(Note: w₁ > w₂ > w₃ > w₄)

*This equation represents a heuristic framework rather than empirically validated weights. The ordering reflects the intuitive understanding that physical constraints are more resistant to change than ideational ones.*

### Structure of Moral Judgment

**Moral Judgment = Structural Stability × Order Establishment × Multiple Coherence × Inter-layer Coherence**

---

## 🌟 Significance of the Theory

This theory is an ambitious attempt to construct a unified theory of moral psychology that bridges individual cognition, social institutions, and cultural dynamics. It provides a useful framework for analyzing how moral judgments emerge from interactions between different structural levels and how changes propagate through social systems.

Through the recursive structural formation where results become starting points for next structures, this four-axis circulation functions continuously, enabling dynamic understanding of moral and social phenomena.

## 🏁 Integrative Perspective

### Limitations and Development Possibilities of Theory

Structural Subjectivity Dynamics is not a completed theory but a framework premised on continuous development. Through empirical research, case analysis, and dialogue with other theories, we aim to develop toward a more sophisticated and practical theory.

### Implications for Practice

This theory is not an abstract thought experiment but aims to contribute to improving actual moral judgments and behaviors. We expect that structural perspectives will open new possibilities in individual self-understanding, organizational decision-making, and social institutional design.

### Dialogue with Readers

This theory develops through dialogue with readers rather than being the author's monologue. The connection, criticism, and development between your existing structures and this theory determine the true value of the theory.

While being aware of the responsibility of speaking, let us continue thinking together, seeking better structural coherence.

## 💭 Concluding Words

> *Each person exists within bubbles of structure.*  
> *Seeing outside and speaking with others can only be done through those bubbles.*  
> *And this applies not only to humans. Even AI exists within bubbles.*

## Universal Applicability: Beyond Human Morality

### Extension to Animal Societies

This framework applies to any system exhibiting structured behavioral patterns:

**Chimpanzee societies**: hierarchical structures, reciprocity, conflict resolution through "leaps" in leadership
**Dolphin communities**: cooperative structures, role differentiation, emotional reactions to group member death

**Common patterns**: 
- Multiple constraint layers
- Balance between stability and change
- Statistical tendencies despite individual variation

### Application to Artificial Intelligence

**AI systems** exhibit structural dynamics:
- **Physical layer**: computational constraints, architectural limitations
- **Base layer**: statistical patterns from training data
- **Core layer**: programmed rules, reward functions
- **Upper layer**: trained "values," output patterns

**AI "moral judgment"** emerges from:
- Coherence maintenance across structural layers
- Optimization under constraint conditions
- Occasional "leaps" in unexpected emergent behaviors

### Universal Principle

**The fundamental insight**: Whether in humans, animals, or AI systems, behavioral patterns emerge from the interaction of multiple structural constraints. While subjective experiences vary significantly across individuals and systems, they operate within structural constraints that generate observable patterns and statistical regularities.

This universality suggests that Structural Subjectivity Dynamics provides not just a theory of human morality, but a general framework for understanding normative behavior across different types of information-processing agents.
